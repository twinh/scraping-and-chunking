Click the + that appears in your left margin when you hover over a new line. Choose Image and press enter. Or, type /image and press enter.
Click to upload an image from your computer, embed an image from elsewhere using its URL, or add a stock photo from¬†Unsplash.

Hover over the image and select ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ or ‚ãÆ‚ãÆ ‚Üí Add link.
Paste a link or select a Notion page as the destination. If you choose a Notion page, a backlink won‚Äôt be created.

Of course, you can also add an image to the body of any page inside a database using /image or drag-and-drop.
Files
